FTND frequently does research and publishes stories that other like-minded organizations reference.  They also have created a mobile app called "Fortify" that is designed to help pornasexuals think more deeply about the effects porn has on them and why they should quit using porn.  Clay Olsen is the co-founder and main face of the organization.</td>
